With 100Hz high refresh rate, better gaming sessions are in your future as it provides a clear visible advantage in competitive environments. Captivate and immerse a larger audience with Sceptre's 35-inch 21:9 UltraWide curved monitor. With an 1800R curved design that accurately resembles the contours of the human eye, a better gaming session is in play. By closely mirroring the shape of the human field of vision, an unprecedented level of clarity and immersion is delivered, while reducing the amount of strain on your eyes. Equipped with Blue Light Shift technology, reduce the amount of blue light being emitted from your monitor so you can game and work longer with more comfort, without straining your eyes. Powered by a VA (Vertical Alignment) panel that delivers advanced refresh rates, sharper contrast ratios, and stellar viewing angles, these assets make this panel ideal for gaming and artistic pursuits. With an LED Display that delivers sharper contrasts between lights and darks while delivering a vast array of rich colors, a more pleasing experience is delivered. With a 320 cd/m² brightness, being able to detect subtle and robust color variations has never been easier, and comes in handy when working on creative projects. Multitasking has never been easier with the PBP and PIP features this monitor provides. PBP (Picture-by-Picture) enables the ability to separate the screen in half by displaying output from two different sources to the left and right sides of the screen. PIP (Picture-in-Picture) is also available for split screen, but differs as one source is displayed on the main screen at the same time another source displays in a sub window. By delivering exceptional clarity across every inch of our screen, this curved monitor eliminates the need for a dual monitor setup. Our 35-inch monitor also features AMD FreeSync™ Premium, providing gamers with smoother video and seamless on-the-spot movement in the fast-paced games by synchronizing the graphic card and monitor refresh rates in order to eliminate tearing and stuttering. With 100Hz refresh rate, images transition rapidly and smoothly while still outpacing the standard conventional monitor. Anti-flicker technology is also available to provide a crisper image by preventing the backlight from flickering periodically. FPS (First Person Shooter) and RTS (Real-Time Strategy), Sceptre's custom set display settings for gaming, are also available for a more enhanced experience. Multiple ports are offered with HDMI 1 & DP 1 delivering up to 100Hz and HDMI 2 & HDMI 3 delivering up to 60Hz refresh rates. Can't find the right angle? With our tiltable design, find that sweet spot that bridges clarity and comfort for your daily computer usage. This monitor also features an aesthetic back cover equipped with LED lights to deliver a unique and modern design. With an equipped VESA wall mount pattern, enjoy the option of attaching the monitor to an articulating arm or mount on the wall for your ideal setup. With our edgeless design, gaming and entertainment has never looked so good."
